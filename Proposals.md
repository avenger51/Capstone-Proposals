
Project ideas/proposals:

Proposal 1:
Proposal one was to be a movie trivia website. A user could login and be presented with movie trivia.  The
user score could be added to the database and the leaderboard would display rankings of users.

Proposal 2:
Proposal two was to be a ChatGPT integration that could be used for a particular topic (news, science, etc) The discovered
answers from ChatGPT could be stored into a database for local storage.

Proposal 3:
The third proposal is a Stocks news and stock ticker lookup website that would also allow users to build their
own stock portfolio.  


Final Proposal:

-The Stocks project is intended to provide a user with stock news and their own secure login that provides a stock ticker
symbol search that displays real time stock data:
Closing Price
Change
Change Percentage
High
Low
Open
Previous Close
Time
-A second function was to include a function for the user to add x amount of stocks at y price to build their own
portfolio, but time did not allow this to be added.
-The 'homepage' is designed to provide real time stock news.
